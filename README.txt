READ ME - Ramesh Kalagnanam - Mission to Mars

I would like to provide a few notes about the Mission to Mars home work I have submitted as follows:

1. I requested Lisa Shemancik to give me an extension during our conversation on Tuesday, August 20, 2019 and she was 
   kind enough to grant my request. I conveyed this to Michael Dinh during the class on Saturday, August 24, 2019.
    
2. I would like to acknowledge direction given to me for different aspects of the homework by Michael. In fact, he was 
   gracious enough to spend a few minutes with me at 7:30 PM yesterday (August 24) after he as done with another class
   he was teaching. This is called "going above and beyond" expectations and when the instructor is willing to do that,
   it also motivates the student to excel. 

3. I also spoke with others in the class - notably, Nand Kishore Sagi, Alex Jose, Kent Bryant and Carlos Moreno. These 
   conversations were about: which of the exercises in the Activities in the module are best suited for emulation; 
   general architecture of the files, etc. - all high level.
